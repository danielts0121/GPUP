# Graph Management System 

A system I built during a course in the academy that lasted 3 months.
The system gets the XML files of a directed graphs and manage the information of the graph as well as perform tasks on it. The system is sitting on a server I built on Apache Tomcat.
In addition I have built clients that creates session to the server with Http requests to receive and send information.
While working on the project I learned to work with the OkHttp and GSON libraries.
The clients were built using JAVAFX and JAXB.
